  <h2>Life Story</h2>
  <p3>I was born on 2005 February 17th, 2005 and raised in Jeonju, S. Korea, a city that boasts Korea's urban technology and its traditional culture, by my grandparents until the age of 10.
    <br /> Then, I have moved to Seoul for 2 years. <br />Moving to Shanghai had created one of the biggest change in my life, I have learned different types of cultures and life-learned lesson due to bigger point of view that the place provided.
    <br /> After 3 years, I came back to Seoul and live here until now. </p3>

  <p3>Even though it is a hard car to handle, the car has a powerful mid-RPM torque and a joyful feeling of controlling RR.<br /> Also, it is so attractive how Porsche had solved the problem of 911's weird weight balance, caused by its rear-engined layout, with precise calculations.</p3>
